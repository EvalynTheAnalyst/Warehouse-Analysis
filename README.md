## Warehouse Analysis with Power BI

🚀 Overview
This project analyzes warehouse performance using Power BI, focusing on inventory turnover, space utilization, and operational efficiency. By leveraging data visualization, SQL, and DAX, this analysis provides actionable insights to optimize warehouse operations and enhance profitability.

🔍 Objective
To identify key performance indicators (KPIs) and uncover optimization opportunities for improved warehouse efficiency, cost control, and revenue growth.

📌 Steps Followed

#1️⃣ ***Data Collection & Cleaning***
Extracted warehouse inventory data from SQL databases.

Cleaned and structured the data to remove inconsistencies and missing values.

Ensured accurate SKU categorization for better segmentation.

2️⃣ ***Data Analysis & Visualization (Power BI)***

Created interactive dashboards to visualize stock turnover, storage efficiency, and sales trends.

3️⃣ ***Key Insights from Analysis***

. Fast-moving vs. Slow-moving Items → Identified stock that needs replenishment vs. items taking up space.
. Space Utilization → Highlighted inefficiencies in warehouse slotting.
. Profitability Analysis → Assessed revenue contribution per product category to prioritize high-margin items.

***Recommendations for Warehouse Optimization***

 1️⃣ Optimize Warehouse Space Allocation
. Leverage Dynamic Slotting & AI-Driven Allocation

Store high-demand items (e.g., groceries, clothing) near packing stations to reduce retrieval time.

Allocate more space to high-margin products (books, toys) to maximize profitability.

 2️⃣ Enhance Operational Efficiency
 
🔍 Identify low-profit items and renegotiate supplier costs.

📈 Implement dynamic pricing strategies for slow-moving inventory.

🚚 Use cross-docking techniques to minimize unnecessary storage time.

 3️⃣ Improve Planning

Deploy automated alerts for inefficient storage to enable real-time adjustments.

🎯 **Conclusion**

The warehouse demonstrates strong revenue and profit margins, but opportunities exist to enhance inventory efficiency, reduce costs, and optimize warehouse space utilization. Implementing these recommendations will drive higher profitability and operational excellence.
