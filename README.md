## Objective ##
To identify key performance indicators (KPIs) and uncover optimization opportunities for improved warehouse efficiency, cost control, and revenue growth.

## Steps Followed ##

#### 1 ***Data Collection & Cleaning***
- Extracted warehouse inventory data from SQL databases.

- Cleaned and structured the data to remove inconsistencies and missing values.

- Ensured accurate SKU categorization for better segmentation.

#### 2️ ***Data Analysis & Visualization (Power BI)***

- Created interactive dashboards to visualize stock turnover, storage efficiency, and sales trends.

#### 3️ ***Key Insights from Analysis***

- Fast-moving vs Slow-moving Items → Identified stock that needs replenishment vs. items taking up space.
- Space Utilization → Highlighted inefficiencies in warehouse slotting.
- Profitability Analysis → Assessed revenue contribution per product category to prioritize high-margin items.

***Recommendations for Warehouse Optimization***

 1️ Optimize Warehouse Space Allocation
- Leverage Dynamic Slotting & AI-Driven Allocation

- Store high-demand items (e.g., groceries, clothing) near packing stations to reduce retrieval time.

- Allocate more space to high-margin products (books, toys) to maximize profitability.

 2️ Enhance Operational Efficiency
 
 - Identify low-profit items and renegotiate supplier costs.

 - Implement dynamic pricing strategies for slow-moving inventory.

 - Use cross-docking techniques to minimize unnecessary storage time.

#### 3️ Improve Planning


- Deploy automated alerts for inefficient storage to enable real-time adjustments.

## **Conclusion** ##

The warehouse demonstrates strong revenue and profit margins, but opportunities exist to enhance inventory efficiency, reduce costs, and optimize warehouse space utilization. Implementing these recommendations will drive higher profitability and operational excellence.
